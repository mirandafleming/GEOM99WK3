	<h3>General History</h3>
	<p> Patterson Lake is in the area of the ancient Champlain seabed and lies in unceded Algonquin territory.
	Settlement of the area began around 1812 and most of the industry was timber-related as the land is not good for farming.
	Patterson Lake currently exits within Dalhousie Township in Lanark County.
	The lake is named after Archie Patterson, a settler who arrived in 1821. </p>
	<p> In the surrounding area is the Purdon Conservation area, which houses the largest colony of Showy Lady’s Slipper Orchids in the country.
	The plants are uncommon due to habitat loss, disturbance by humans, and transplant attempts.
	The colony was discovered in the 1930’s by Joe Purdon, who found the orchids on his land.</p>
